## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CUBE CSS

### What I learned

I tried to use this project has a step stone on my css journe. Working with CUBE CSS was a good to write better css and understand more of the workflow of the project.

```css
.flow > * + * {
  margin-top: 1em;
}
```

Learning this bit of CSS was really good, applying a margin only on elements within the flow container that have a sibling avoid you having to be specific with our components, leaving a more readable CSS.

### Continued development

I'll continue to work with CUBE CSS on future projects so I can understand better the methodology being used to write better and scalable CSS

### Useful resources
